            <p>
                 Optic nerves are of two types. These include cones and rods.<br>
                <b>Cones</b>: Cones are the nerve cells that are more sensitive to bright light. They help in detailed central and colour vision.
                <b>Rods</b>: Rods are the optic nerve cells that are more sensitive to dim lights. They help in peripheral vision.
