                The conjunctiva is a thin, transparent membrane that covers the white part of the eye (the sclera) and lines the inside of the eyelids It lines the sclera and is made up of stratified squamous epithelium. It keeps our eyes moist and clear and provides lubrication by secreting mucus and tears.The conjunctiva also plays a role in protecting the eye from foreign particles and pathogens.<br>
