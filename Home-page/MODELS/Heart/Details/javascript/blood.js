Pulmonary circulation:   The flow of blood between the heart and lungs through pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein.  it starts when the right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood into the lungs through pulmonary artery to exchange carbon dioxide to oxygen.   The oxygenated blood travels back to the heart and the left atrium via pulmonary vein.     Systemic circulation:The flow of oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart to the rest of the body (with the exception of lungs).     oxygen is delivered to the body tissue and exchange to carbon dioxide.      The deoxygenated blood is carried back to the heart and the atrium via veins.";
