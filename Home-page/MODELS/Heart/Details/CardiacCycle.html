            <h1>Cardiac Cycle</h1>
            <p> The cardiac cycle refers to sequence of events that occur during one complete heartbeat,involving the contraction and relaxation of heart muscles to pump blood.</p>
            
            <p>         

 <b>Atrial Diastole (Relaxation of the Atria):</b><br>
    <li> Atria are relaxed and filling with blood from the body (right atrium via the superior and inferior vena cava) and the lungs (left atrium via the pulmonary veins).</li>
    <li>The atrioventricular (AV) valves (tricuspid and mitral valves) are closed.</li><br>

<b>Ventricular Diastole (Relaxation of the Ventricles):</b><br>
   <li>The ventricles are also relaxed and expand to allow the entry of blood.</li>
   <li>Once atrial pressure exceeds ventricular pressure, the AV valves open, and blood flows passively from the atria into the ventricles.</li><br>

<b>Atrial Systole (Contraction of the Atria):</b><br>
   <li>The atria contract, pushing the remaining blood (30% of the total ventricular volume) into the ventricles.</li>
   <li>This ensures the ventricles are fully filled with blood.</li><br>

<b>Ventricular Systole (Contraction of the Ventricles):</b>
<br><br>
   <b>1.Isovolumetric Contraction Phase:</b><br>
     <li>Ventricular contraction begins, but no blood is ejected yet because both the AV and semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary) are closed.</li>
     <li>Pressure rises within the ventricles.</li>
     <br>
     <b>2.Ejection Phase:</b>
     <br>
     <li>Once ventricular pressure exceeds the pressure in the aorta and pulmonary arteries, the semilunar valves open.</li>
     <li>Blood is ejected from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery (toward the lungs) and from the left ventricle into the aorta (toward the body).</li><br>
    <b>Isovolumetric Relaxation Phase:</b><br>

   <li>After the ventricles eject blood, they begin to relax.</li>
   <li>The pressure in the ventricles falls, and the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary) close to prevent backflow of blood.</li>
   <li>Both the AV valves and semilunar valves are closed briefly as the ventricles relax, causing the pressure to drop further.</li><br>
<b>Return to Ventricular Diastole:</b><br>

   <li>As ventricular pressure falls below atrial pressure, the AV valves open, and the cycle repeats.</li>
<li>Blood from the atria passively fills the ventricles in preparation for the next heartbeat.</li><br>


<b>Valve Activity During the Cycle:</b>
<li>AV Valves (Tricuspid and Mitral) - Open during ventricular diastole (filling phase), close during ventricular systole (to prevent backflow into the atria).</li>
<li>Semilunar Valves (Pulmonary and Aortic) - Open during ventricular systole (ejection phase), close during ventricular diastole (to prevent backflow from arteries).</li><br>
 <b>Duration:</b><br>
<li>The entire cardiac cycle lasts about 0.8 seconds at a normal heart rate of 75 beats per minute.</li>
