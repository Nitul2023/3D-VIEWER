<h1>Midbrain</h1>
      The midbrain is a small but important part of the brain that's located at the top of the brainstem and between the
      forebrain and hindbrain.<br>
      It is responsible for many functions, including Motor movement,Visual and auditory processing,Eye movement,Body
      coordination and temperature control.<br>
     <li> The mid brain is made up of three main parts - The colliculi, The tegmentum, and The cerebral penduncles .</li>
       <li>It also contains the cerebral aqueduct, which allows cerebrospinal fluid to pass from the third ventricle to the fourth
      ventricle.</li><br><br>
      <b>Colliculi:</b> These are a pair of anatomical prominences in the midbrain that are part of the corpora
      quadrigemina. There are two types of colliculi - Inferior colliculus and superior colliculus.<br>
      <b>Tegmentum :</b> It is the the central core of the midbrain that contains several important cell populations,
      nuclei, and fiber tracts.<br>
      <b>Cerebral penduncles:</b> It is also known as Crus cerebri, are a pair of large bundles of fibers in the midbrain
      that connect the forebrain to the brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. They play a key role in motor function.
