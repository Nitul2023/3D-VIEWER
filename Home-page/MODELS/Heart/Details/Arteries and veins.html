            <h1>Arteries</h1>
            <p>
                An artery is a type of blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart to various parts of the
                body.Arteries are thick walled and muscular,allowing them to withstand high blood pressure. They branch
                into smaller arterioles,which lead to capillaries where oxygen and nutrient are exchanged.<br>
                <b>Types of artery:</b><br>
                1.Aorta:The largest artery in the body,the aorta begins at the left ventricles of the heart.<br>
                2.Pulmonary artery: carry deoxygented blood from the heart to the lungs.<br>
                3.systematic artery:supply oxygented blood from the heart to the rest of the body.<br>
                4. Coronary arteries: Supply oxygenated blood to the heart muscle itself.<br>
                5. Cerebral arteries: Supply oxygenated blood to the brain.<br>
                6. Renal arteries: Supply oxygenated blood to the kidneys.<br>
                7. Mesenteric arteries: Supply oxygenated blood to the intestines.<br>
                8. Femoral arteries: Supply oxygenated blood to the legs.<br>
                <!-- 9. Axillary arteries: Supply oxygenated blood to the arms.<br> -->
                <!-- 10. Carotid arteries: Supply oxygenated blood to the head and neck.<br>
            11. Iliac arteries: Supply oxygenated blood to the pelvis and legs.<br>
            12. Subclavian arteries: Supply oxygenated blood to the arms.<br>
            13. Brachiocephalic arteries: Supply oxygenated blood to the head, neck, and arms.<br> -->

            <h1>Veins</h1>
            <p>
                Blood vessel that carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart.<br>
                <b>Types of veins:</b><br>
                1.Venacava:The largest vein in the body is venacava.The superior venacava carries blood from the head
                and arms and Inferior venacava carries blood from the abdomen and legs<br>
                2. Coronary Sinus: Receives blood from the great cardiac vein, middle cardiac vein, and small cardiac
                veins.<br>
                3. Great Cardiac Vein: Drains blood from the left atrium and left ventricle.<br>
                4. Middle Cardiac Vein: Drains blood from the left ventricle. <br>
                5. Small Cardiac Vein: Drains blood from the right atrium and right ventricle.<br>
                6. Anterior Cardiac Veins: Drain blood from the front of the heart.<br>
                7. Posterior Cardiac Veins: Drain blood from the back of the heart.<br>
                8. Oblique Vein of Left Atrium: Drains blood from the left atrium.<br>
                9. Left Marginal Vein: Drains blood from the left ventricle.<br>
                10. Right Marginal Vein: Drains blood from the right ventricle.<br>
