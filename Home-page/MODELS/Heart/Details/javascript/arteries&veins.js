Pulmonary artery: carry deoxygented blood from the heart to the lungs.                    systematic artery:supply oxygented blood from the heart to the rest of the body.                       Coronary arteries: Supply oxygenated blood to the heart muscle itself.                                Cerebral arteries: Supply oxygenated blood to the brain.                                              Renal arteries: Supply oxygenated blood to the kidneys.
