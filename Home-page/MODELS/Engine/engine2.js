    const text = "Internal combustion is the basis for how a bike engine works; it typically uses a four-stroke cycle. The four separate phases of this cycle are the intake,compression, power, and exhaust. A mixture of fuel and air can enter the combustion chamber during the intake stroke when the piston descends and the  intake valve opens. This air-fuel mixture is compressed to raise its temperature and pressure as the piston rises during the compression stroke. In order   to avoid leaks, the intake and exhaust valves stay closed during compression.   A spark plug ignites the compressed air-fuel mixture when the piston reaches the top of the cylinder. The power stroke, which is started by this ignition,is when the combustion gasses rapidly expand, forcing the piston downward and producing the energy needed to move the crankshaft. This linear velocity    is subsequently transformed into rotational motion via the crankshaft, propelling the motorcycle's wheels. Following this, the exhaust stroke happens,  during which the exhaust valve opens and the piston rises once more, releasing the burned gasses into the exhaust system.   The piston, crankshaft, valves, spark plug, and fuel delivery system—which may consist of a fuel injector or a carburetor—are important parts of    this process. The timing system of the engine makes sure that the valves open and close in perfect synchronization with the piston's movement.  Engines are either liquid-cooled or air-cooled, depending on the design, and proper cooling and lubricating systems are necessary to keep them from overheating.";
