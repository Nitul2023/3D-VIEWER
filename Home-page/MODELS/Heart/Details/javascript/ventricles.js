Structure: The walls of the left ventricle are thicker than those of the right ventricle because it needs to generate higher pressure to circulate blood through the entire body.           Blood Flow: Blood enters the left ventricle from the left atrium through the mitral valve and exits through the aortic valve into the aorta.            Right Ventricle:        Function: Pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation.        Structure: Its walls are thinner compared to the left ventricle because it only pumps blood to the lungs, a much shorter distance.      Blood Flow: Blood enters the right ventricle from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve and exits through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery.";
