      <h1>Hindbrain</h1>
      <p>

        The hindbrain is the lower part of the brainstem, connecting the brain to the spinal cord. It is made up of
        three main parts:<br><br>

        <b>1.Medulla Oblongata:</b><br>
        <b>Location:</b>At the base of the brainstem, just above the spinal cord.<br>
        <b>Functions:</b>
        Controls autonomic functions like breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure.
        <li>Manages reflexes like swallowing, coughing, and vomiting.</li>
        <li>Relays nerve signals between the brain and the spinal cord.</li><br>

        <b>2.Pons:</b><br>
        <b>Location:</b> Above the medulla and below the midbrain, part of the brainstem.
        <b>Functions:</b>
        Acts as a bridge between different parts of the brain, including the cerebellum and cerebrum.
        <li>Plays a key role in regulating breathing patterns.</li>
        <li>Involved in sleep cycles, particularly REM(Rapid Eye Movement) sleep.</li>
        <li>Helps with sensory roles, including hearing, taste, and balance.</li><br>

        <b>3.Cerebellum:</b><br>
        <b>Location:</b> Behind the brainstem, under the cerebrum.<br>
        <b>Functions:</b>
        Coordinates voluntary movements such as posture, balance, coordination, and speech.
        <li>Helps in fine-tuning motor activities and maintaining balance.</li>
        <li> Involved in motor learning and adaptation. </li>
