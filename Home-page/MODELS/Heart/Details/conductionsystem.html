            <p>  
                Conduction system is also be called as the electrical activity of the heart.The electrical activity in the heart is displayed as a P wave,QRS interval and T wave.AN electrocardiograph is a medical device used to measure and record of electrical activity of heart during cardiac cycle.<br>                
                1.P wave represent the auricular systol and depolarisation.IIt reflects the electrical activity that causes the atria to contract and push blood into the ventrical.<br>
                2.The QRS complex represents the depolarisation of ventrical.It reflects the electrical activity that causes the ventricles to contract and bump blood to the lungs and rest of the body.<br>
                3.T wave represent the ventricular repolarisation(diastole).It shows the electrical recovery phase as the ventricles reset their electrical state in preparation for the next heartbeat.<br>
