            <h1>Ventricles</h1>
            <p>
                <b>Left Ventricle:</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Function:</b> Pumps oxygenated blood from the lungs into the aorta, and from there to the rest of the
                body.
                <br>
                <b>Structure:</b> The walls of the left ventricle are thicker than those of the right ventricle because
                it needs to generate higher pressure to circulate blood through the entire body.
                <br>
                <b>Blood Flow:</b> Blood enters the left ventricle from the left atrium through the mitral valve and
                exits through the aortic valve into the aorta.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Right Ventricle:</b>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Function:</b> Pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation.
                <br>
                <b>Structure:</b> Its walls are thinner compared to the left ventricle because it only pumps blood to
                the lungs, a much shorter distance.
                <br>
                <b>Blood Flow:</b> Blood enters the right ventricle from the right atrium through the tricuspid valve
                and exits through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery.
