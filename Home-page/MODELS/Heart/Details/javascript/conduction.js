AN electrocardiograph is a medical device used to measure and record of electrical activity of heart during cardiac cycle.      P wave represent the auricular systol and depolarisation.   It reflects the electrical activity that causes the atria to contract and push blood into the ventrical.      The QRS complex represents the depolarisation of ventrical.   It reflects the electrical activity that causes the ventricles to contract and bump blood to the lungs and rest of the body.     T wave represent the ventricular repolarisation(diastole).     It shows the electrical recovery phase as the ventricles reset their electrical state in preparation for the next heartbeat.";
