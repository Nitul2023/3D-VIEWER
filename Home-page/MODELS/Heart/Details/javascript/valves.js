Four types of valves regulate blood flow through your heart: • The tricuspid valve regulates blood flow between the right atrium and right ventricle. • The pulmonary valve controls blood flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary arteries, which carry blood to your lungs to pick up oxygen. • The mitral valve lets oxygen-rich blood from your lungs pass from the left atrium into the left ventricle. • The aortic valve opens the way for oxygen-rich blood to pass from the left ventricle into the aorta, your body's largest artery, where it is delivered to the rest of your body.";
