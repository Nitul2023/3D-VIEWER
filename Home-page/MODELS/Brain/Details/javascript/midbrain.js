It is responsible for many functions, including Motor movement,Visual and auditory processing,Eye movement,Body coordination and temperature control.   The mid brain is made up of three main parts - The colliculi, The tegmentum, and The cerebral penduncles .  It also contains the cerebral aqueduct, which allows cerebrospinal fluid to pass from the third ventricle to the fourth ventricle.          Colliculi: These are a pair of anatomical prominences in the midbrain that are part of the corpora quadrigemina. There are two types of colliculi - Inferior colliculus and superior colliculus     Tegmentum : It is the the central core of the midbrain that contains several important cell populations, nuclei, and    fiber tracts.      Cerebral penduncles: It is also known as Crus cerebri, are a pair of large bundles of fibers in the midbrain that connect the forebrain to the brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. They play a key role in motor function.";
