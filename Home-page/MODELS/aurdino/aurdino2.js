Working principal of aurdino.The working principle of an Arduino is based on its microcontroller, which can read inputs (such as signals from sensors) and generate outputs (such as controlling motors or LEDs) according to the code uploaded to it.Coding Create a program using the Arduino programming language within the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE).Compilationm The IDE translates the written code into machine code that the microcontroller can understand.Upload Transfer the compiled code to the Arduino board via USB or serial connection.Execution The microcontroller runs the uploaded program, performing the specified tasks.Interaction The program interacts with external devices through input/output operations, reading data from sensors and controlling actuators using digital and analog pins.How Arduino Works   The microcontroller executes the program, reading from sensors and writing to actuators.    The program uses loops (e.g., setup() and loop()) to repeatedly execute tasks.  Conditional statements and functions control the program flow.  Complex tasks are streamlined with libraries and built-in functions, such as serial communication.";
