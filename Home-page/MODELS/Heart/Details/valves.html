            <h1>Valves</h1>
            <p>Heart valves are flap-like structures that allow blood to flow in one direction. Four types of valves regulate blood flow through your heart:<br><br>
                <b>•</b> The tricuspid valve regulates blood flow between the right atrium and right ventricle.<br>
                <b>•</b> The pulmonary valve controls blood flow from the right ventricle into the pulmonary arteries, which carry blood to your lungs to pick up oxygen.<br>
                <b>•</b> The mitral valve lets oxygen-rich blood from your lungs pass from the left atrium into the left ventricle.<br>
                <b>•</b> The aortic valve opens the way for oxygen-rich blood to pass from the left ventricle into the aorta, your body's largest artery, where it is delivered to the rest of your body.<br>
